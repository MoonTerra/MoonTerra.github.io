Morterra is an online survival game set at the dawn of man. You awake with absolutely nothing and must find food, water, and protection from others. You will need tools to build a base to protect yourself, armors to defend against attacks, and weapons to fight back. You will eventually grow tired and need to sleep. However, while you sleep you are still vulnerable to attacks, so you must build adequate protection for yourself to survive the night.
</p>
<p>
The world contains no edges, no "safe-zones" (other than bases you build for yourself), and players can construct/destruct at their own will, but be conscious of whose stuff you destroy!
</p>
<h3>
Alpha-Testing
</h3>
<p>
We are currently in Alpha testing, so remember that the game is still in early development, and there is a high chance of your progress being deleted. Please be patient while we work towards making the game fully functional!
